# Redux example streams

This is a small example application based on react, redux and redux-thunk.

To start the application, navigate in both directories `api/` and `client/` in
two different terminals and run `npm install` and `npm start` in each one.
This will start the mock api server and the react frontend accessing the data.

Then you can start creating, editing and deleting streams.

Api calls are handled by the middleware redux-thunk.
